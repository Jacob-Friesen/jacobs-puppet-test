# Jacobs Puppet Test
A Puppet Enterprise test repository. Which is an automation tool for Configuration Management of infrastructure. **All the real code is currently in the `production` branch which is managed by the Puppet Master Server**

At this point, this will not be used for any of my projects at work or otherwise. So no further work will be done on it.
